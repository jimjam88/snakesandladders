## Snakes & Ladders

This Javascript game plays snakes and ladders automatically.

### The Rules
* If your new position after the roll divides by 9 (9, 18, 27, 36â€¦) you landed on a snake and must move back 3 places
* If your new position after the roll is 25 or 55 you must move forward 10 places
* If your roll is near the end of the game and you do not roll enough to move exactly to 100, you do not move forward
